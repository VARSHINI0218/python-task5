URL Shortener Description:

Objective: The aim of this project is to develop a URL shortening service that converts long URLs into shorter, more user-friendly links, while also tracking the mappings between short and long URLs for redirection purposes.

URL Shortening Algorithm: The URL shortener employs an algorithm to generate unique and short aliases for long URLs. Common algorithms include base conversion, hashing (e.g., MD5, SHA-256), or using a combination of alphanumeric characters.

Input Handling: Users can input long URLs into the service through a user interface or API endpoint. The service validates the input URLs to ensure they are properly formatted and valid.

Short URL Generation: Upon receiving a long URL, the service generates a corresponding short URL using the chosen algorithm. The short URL is unique and deterministic, ensuring that the same long URL always maps to the same short URL.

Redirection Mapping: The service maintains a mapping between short and long URLs to facilitate redirection. When users access a short URL, the service looks up the corresponding long URL and redirects the user's browser accordingly.

Customization Options: Optionally, users may have the ability to customize the generated short URLs with a custom alias or keyword. This feature enhances user experience and allows for memorable and meaningful short links.

Link Analytics: The URL shortener may offer analytics and tracking features to monitor the usage and performance of shortened links. This includes metrics such as click-through rates, geographic distribution of clicks, referrers, etc.

Expiration and Revocation: Optionally, the service may support expiration dates or revocation of short URLs. This allows users to set a lifespan for shortened links or revoke access to them if necessary.

Security Measures: The URL shortener implements security measures to protect against misuse and abuse, such as rate limiting, CAPTCHA verification, and preventing malicious or spammy URLs.
